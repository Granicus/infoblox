## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'infoblox'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install infoblox

# Usage

## Connecting
Before operating against Infoblox, an instance of the `Infoblox::Connection` class is necessary:

    connection = Infoblox::Connection.new(username: '', password: '', host: '')

You can specify SSL options by using the `ssl_opts` option.  The options are passed to the HTTP adapter, which is `net/http` by default. 

    connection = Infoblox::Connection.new(username: '', password: '', host: '', ssl_opts: {verify: false})

You can supply a logger to get debugging information: 

    connection = Infoblox::Connection.new(username: '', password: '', host: '', logger: Logger.new(STDOUT))

It is possible to set timeout, read and write timeout:

    connection = Infoblox::Connection.new(username: '', password: '', host: '', timeout: 120)

## Reading
Each resource class implements `.all`, `.find`, and `#get`.   

### `.find`
Use find when you don't know what you are looking for or you don't have a `_ref` saved (see `get` below).  Use `_max_results` to limit / expand the number of returned results.

    # You can find hosts that match a regular expression:
    Infoblox::Host.find(connection, {"name~" => "demo[0-9]{1,}-web.domain"})
    # => [...]

### `.all`
Show all results (note that this is limited by `_max_results`).  Use this cautiously when you have a large potential set of results.
    
    # Find all networks. Note that this is limited to 1000 objects, as per the 
    # Infoblox WAPI documentation. 
    Infoblox::Network.all(connection)
    # => [...]

    # If you want more than 1,000 records, use `_max_results`:
    Infoblox::Network.all(connection, _max_results: 7890)
   
The usage of search parameters is well-documented in the Infoblox WAPI documentation, and this client supports them fully.

### `#get`
Use this when you have saved a reference (`_ref`) and want to load it later. 

    host = Infoblox::Host.new(:connection => c, :_ref => ref).get
    puts host.name 
    # => foo.bar

## Searching
You can also search across all Infoblox resource types using the `Infoblox::Search` resource. The response will contain any number of `Infoblox::Resource` subclass instances. 

    result = Infoblox::Search.find(connection, "search_string~" => "webserver-")
    # => [#<Infoblox::Host>, #<Infoblox::Ptr>, ...]
    
## Writing and deleting
The resource class instances implement `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` methods, which correspond to the REST verbs supported by the WAPI.  For example, here is how to create, update, and delete a network:
 
    # create
    network = Infoblox::Network.new(connection: connection)
    network.network = "10.20.30.0/24"
    network.extensible_attributes = {"VLAN" => "my_vlan"}
    network.auto_create_reversezone = true
    network.post

    # update
    network.network = "10.20.31.0/24"
    network.put

    # delete
    network.delete

This pattern applies for interacting with every resource.  Supported resources include:
    
    Infoblox::AAAArecord
    Infoblox::Arecord
    Infoblox::Cname
    Infoblox::Fixedaddress
    Infoblox::Grid
    Infoblox::Host
    Infoblox::HostIpv4addr
    Infoblox::Ipv4address
    Infoblox::Lease
    Infoblox::Mx
    Infoblox::Network
    Infoblox::NetworkContainer
    Infoblox::Ptr
    Infoblox::Range
    Infoblox::RoamingHost
    Infoblox::Search
    Infoblox::Srv
    Infoblox::Txt
    Infoblox::ZoneAuth
    Infoblox::ZoneForward

The specific attributes supported by each resource are listed in the source code.  Adding a new resource class is easy, and pull requests are encouraged. 

## Changing IP on an existing host
To change the IP of an existing host, you have to poke around in the ipv4addrs collection to find the one you are looking for.  The example below assumes that there is only one ipv4 address and just overwrites it. 

    host = Infoblox::Host.find(connection, {"name~" => "my.host.name"}).first
    host.ipv4addrs[0].ipv4addr = "10.10.10.10"
    host.put

## Basic CRUD examples

To do basic create/update/delete operations on an a_record/ptr_record set:

Create:

    a_record = Infoblox::Arecord.new(
      connection: connection, 
      name:       <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr:   <ip_address>)
    a_record.post
    
    ptr_record = Infoblox::Ptr.new(
      connection: connection, 
      ptrdname:   <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr:   <ip_address>)
    ptr_record.post

Update:

    a_record = Infoblox::Arecord.find(connection, {
      name:     <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr: <ip_address>
    }).first
    a_record.name     = <fqdn>
    a_record.ipv4addr = <ip_address>
    a_record.view     = nil
    a_record.put

    ptr_record = Infoblox::Ptr.find(connection, {
      ptrdname: <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr: <ip_address>
    }).first

    ptr_record.ptrdname = <fqdn>
    ptr_record.ipv4addr = <ip_address>
    ptr_record.view = nil
    ptr_record.put

Delete:

    a_record = Infoblox::Arecord.find(connection, {
      name:     <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr: <ip_address>
    }).first
    a_record.delete
    
    ptr_record = Infoblox::Ptr.find(connection, {
      ptrdname: <fqdn>, 
      ipv4addr: <ip_address>
    }).first
    ptr_record.delete

## Next Available IP

The `Infoblox::Network` and `Infoblox::Range` objects support the `next_available_ip` WAPI function: 

    network = Infoblox::Network.find(connection, 
                                     network: '10.21.0.0/24').first
    puts network.next_available_ip.inspect
    #=> ["10.21.0.22"]

Note that this function does not work on a resource that has not been created.  In other words, if you want to get the next available IP for a given network segment, you have to create that segment beforehand.  See the CRUD examples above. 


## Extensible Attributes

Extensible attributes are supported in this client.  It should be noted that in WAPI versions before 1.2,  the field is named "extensible_attributes", whereas in version 1.2 and later, it is named "extattrs". 

## Infoblox Version Compatibility

This gem is known to be compatible with Infoblox versions 1.0 through 2.0.  While Infoblox claims that their API is backwards-compatible, one caveat remains with the Extensible Attributes (see elsewhere in this document).  Some features are only available in newer versions (such as Fixedaddress and AAAARecord).  For best results, set the version using the `WAPI_VERSION` environment variable.  For example: 

    WAPI_VERSION=1.2 ruby my_script.rb

The default version is 2.0. 

## Ruby Version Compatibility

This gem is tested against Ruby versions 1.9.3, 2.1.6, JRuby-head, and JRuby in 1.9 mode.

The last compatible version with Ruby 1.8.x is 2.0.5.

## Development / testing

First, clone and bundle: 

    bundle install

To run the tests: 

    rspec

To run the integration tests (you will be prompted for your Infoblox credentials):

    INTEGRATION=true bundle
    INTEGRATION=true rspec

Please note that the integration tests do not work in Ruby 1.8.7, but the unit tests function normally.
